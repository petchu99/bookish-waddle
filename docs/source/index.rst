Welcome to SamePHY documentation!
===================================

Walking you through on ALL ABOUT THE SamePHY BOARD and how to use SamePHY seamlessly.

Basicly, SamePHY(also known as "The IOT Router" ) is an easy development board which (amongst its other uses and capabilities) primarily functions as a gateway of all sorts of radios/wireless communication thereby brigding all similar or dissimilar wireless communication protocol.

In another situation where you want to use the bluetooth device (A) to access the internet or collect data from the internet, SamePHY has come to your rescue !. With your "only-GSM" enabled device, you may also want to send data to and from a WiFi device, don't worry SamePHY would mediate between them and the list goes on and on. You may also want to use SamePHY as gateway in similar communication media e.g WiFi to WiFi ...* 

Being a **one stop solution**, SamePHY has an endless variety of application domains ranging from **simple domains** such as :

* Learning playground for hobbyist and tech enthusiasts
* STEM Educational material for students, 

to  more **complex domains** such as 

* Scientific and Engineering Research purposes, 
* High end industrial automation e.t.c.

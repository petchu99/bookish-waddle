Both flavors are compatible with the Arduino and Raspberry Pi form factors and they only differ in the type of GSM/GPRS modem on-board - that is, where **Module M** uses **SIMXXX** (a modem series from SIMCOM manufacturers), **Module K** uses **BCXX/MCXX** (a modem series from QUECTEL manufacturers).

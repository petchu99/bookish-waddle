Getting Started
===================================

Brief Overview 
--------------

SamePHY is a development board from `aiMeter <https://www.aimeters.com/>` . The SamePHY board is a highly reconfigurable development board, a gateway of all sorts of radios, an Arduino shield, a HAT for two Raspberry Pi and a host for its “Jobs link here”. Being the gateway of all radio communications currently available is the basis for the name (SamePHY) meaning "Same PHYsical" Layer, as it is the last layer/bridge for all radio communications currently available, be it **THREAD, ZIGBEE, BLUETOOTH(BT/BLE), WIFI, LoRa/LoRaWAN, SigFox & wM-Bus, GSM/GPRS NBIoT/LTE Cat M1 (BC66) ...**. With the five(5) SoC's, the board houses up to 7 CPUs and 2 Ultra Low Power Processors all ranging from instruction sets such as ARM, Intel, RISC-V & Xtensa ISAs with a Board Dimension of 51 x 100mm which is lesser than the size of an Arduino Mega Board

Five SoC's on SamePHY
---------------------

There are 5 System on Chip(SoC) onboard SamePHY and they altogether make up the 7 CPUs and 2 Ultra Low Power Processors present on the SamePHY board.
The five SoC's are:

#. ESP32-Wroom (ESP32_TOP)
#. ESP32-S3 (ESP32_BOTTOM)
#. SIMXX (SIM868, SIM7020,SIM7080) or BCXX (BC66,BC65)
#. Wio-E5
#. CH552T
